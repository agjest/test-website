## Recommended Process 

- Do your data wrangling in R using the Tidyverse
- Prepare your map
  * In Qgis
  * In R using sf/sp
- Analysis
  * Write a reproducible document in Rmarkdown
    - Rstudio 1.4 GUI-like interface
    - Zotero integrated

---

## Do your data wrangling in R using the Tidyverse

--

* Use a subdirectory relative to where your main document will reside to contain your data wrangling scripts
 
--

* If you read in raw data from files, use a subdirectory ("raw_data") of the data directory to house your raw data files. 

--

* If you read in the data directly via an api there is no need for a "raw_data" subdirectory

--

* Use an R markdown notebook to document the data wrangling and make it reproducible. Place this R Notebook in your Data directory.
  - Read in the raw data at the top
  - Do your wrangling to __Tidy__ data
  - Prepare an id to later link the data to a map (house id, "kommunenummer", "grunnkretsnummer" etc.)
  - Save out your data in .Rdata and .csv (robust against time decay) formats.
  
--

* Important to get the dataset finished (as far as possible). Will save us huge amounts of time and work.
 
---

## Do your data wrangling in R using the Tidyverse, cont.

--

* Check that the variables have the intended format, date, factor, character, numeric etc.
 
--

* Note the format/class of every variable so that you can read the data correctly back into R (.csv files do not have information about the format of the variables. You have to specify it when you read the data back into R). If you use a .Rdata file R will know the type of each variable.
 
--

* In short: Make your raw data __Tidy__ in a reproducible manner!
  
---

## Prepare your map (map wrangling)

--

* Use a new Rmarkdown notebook to document the preparations done to your map and the merging of data to the map.
 
--

* Use a subdirectory "maps" to do your map wrangling.
 
--

* Document the source of your map, either from file or downloaded from an internet site
 
--

* Depending on the map it might be advantageous to load it into a GIS program, i.e. Qgis. 
 
--

* Qgis will give you a multi layer GIS system with a GUI. The advantage is an intuitive and interactive environment. The drawback is a low level of reproducibility (work done in a GUI is notoriously difficult to make reproducible)
 
--

* An alternative is to use Qgis to experiment with the map and then try to do the same reproducibly in R with the tools discussed below
 
---

## Prepare your map (map wrangling)

--

* Start by filter your map to the wanted area
--

* Fix any topological problems (this can be a real hassle)
--

* Check (and double check) that the ids in the map correspond with the ones in your dataset. 
--

* Merge your dataset to the "features" (points, lines or polygons) in your map. In Qgis or preferably in R.
--

* Check, and double check, that the map and data is as intended.
--

* Save the map in the format "GeoPackage", the "shape" format is ancient, inconvenient (3-5 separate files) and have several technical restrictions (10 char variable names, only proj4 support etc.)

---

## The analysis

--

* Read your map with the dataset into your main document

--

* Generate the weights matrix in R (import to GeoDa) or make it in GeoDa

--

* Start with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in GeoDa

--

* Do descriptive statistics in R

--

* Test for local/global spatial autocorrelation i.e. global/local Morans I in your dependent variable.

---

## The analysis

--
- If no spatial autocorrelation, do normal linear regression (or whatever)
- If spatial autocorrelation present.
    - Estimate initial linear model
      - Check for spatial effects in __residuals__
      - Our linear model _might_ (not likely) be so good that no 
          spatial effects left in the residuals. If this is the case keep the plain linear model.
- If there is spatial effects in residuals. We have to account for this.
- Use sf/sp and test models
- Do we have a local or global phenomenon?
  - __Local__: Start with SDEM and test against nested models with likelihood ratio tests
  - __Global__: Start with SDM and test against nested models with likelihood ratio tests
- Thoroughly test your final spatial regression model.
    - Heteroscedasticity, normality residuals etc.

## Maps for analysis/illustration

--

* Maps for analysis often quite terse and contains little geographical information

--

* Should make better/more informative maps for illustrations

--

* Make your illustrative maps with `tmap` or `ggplot2` in R

---

## What we have to learn

--

* Short refresh Tidyverse

--

* How to handle maps
  - How to get them
  - How to get them into our software
  - How to edit/manipulate them
  - How to link maps and data

--

* How to generate neighbour structures
 
---

## What we have to learn cont.

--

* How to make weight matrices

--

* How to run spatial regressions

--

* How to do EDA with spatial data

---

## Before all else

--

* Update R

--

* Update R Studio

--

* Install the packages we will need

--

* Install GeoDa

--

* Install/update Qgis

--

* Update Zotero
