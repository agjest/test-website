- We use knr as id variable

- Precision threshold might help if there is topological problems
- The map is projected UTM N33, unit is meter
- Our threshold 0.5 meter
- Create and then Close

## Global analysis

- we analyse spatial autocorrelation for the whole data set (have we got it?)

## Local analysis

# Select variable and weights

 Documentation is to be found at [https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/5a_global_auto/lab5a.html](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/5a_global_auto/lab5a.html). Most of the following is taken from this source,

.pull-left[
- We select log_pm2 as variable and the queen based contiguity weights

.pull-right[
- Moran's I

$$I = \frac{\sum_i \sum_j w_{ij} · z_i · z_j/S_0}{\sum_i z_i^2/n}$$
der $z_i=x_i -\bar{x}$, $S_0=\sum_i \sum_j w_{ij}$ and $n$ the number of observations.
- remember that the weights are 0 for the ones that are not a neighbour

.pull-right[
- Right click/ctrl click on plot
- Click Randomisation
- Choose 999 Permutations

## Interpretation

- Distribution of 999 randomisations (the values of log_pm2 are randomly appoint to different municipalities)
- The vertical line is the mean I from the randomisation (-0,0026)
- The green vertical line is I for our data 0,2961
- Our I lies far to the right of the distribution
- Evidence of positive spatial autocorrelation in our data

# Spatial Correlogram

.pull-left[
- standardised variables (mu=0, sd=1)
- $z_i · z_j = f(d_{ij}) + u$
- $d_{ij}$, distance between "center" of $i$ polygon and $j$ polygon
- The smoothed line on the top shows how auto-correlation depends upon distance between to places. The bar shows how many obs. we have for each distance
- Distance in meter, so max. dist. in figure is 70 km (ca. 1,5 hours of commute time)

## LISA

- High-High: this muni is high and its neighbouring munis are high
- Low-Low: this muni is low and its neighbouring munis are low
- Low-High; this muni is low, but its neighbours are high
- High-Low; this muni is high, but its munis are low
- Can this be connected with infrastructure?
- Note when High-High is clicked in the top map. The High-High munis are selected in both figures

## Significance

.pull-left[
![:scale 70%](eda_insertimage_20.png)
]
.pul-right[
- Global Morans I: $I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij}·z_i·z_j}{\sum_i z_i^2}$
- Local Morans I: $I_i = \frac{\sum_j w_{ij}·z_i·z_j}{\sum_i z_i^2}$
- The global Morans I corresponds with the average of the local Morans I (details Anselin 1995)
- Significance: analytic or conditional permutations
- Analytical not very reliable in practice (Anselin 1995)
- Conditional permutations: For each obs. (here muni) the local value is kept constant (log_pm2 for this muni) while the remaining n-1 values are randomly permuted. 
- In this way we build a reference distribution
- The real value is then compared to this distribution
- Generate a "pseudo p-value" that can be used to assess significance

# Other analysis in GeoDa

- Different kinds of plots, univariate, bivariate and multivariate
  - Histogram, boxplot, scatter plot, bubble chart, 3d chart, Parallel Coordinate Plot and Conditional Plots
  - Plots will be linked
  - Tools like brushing, selection of subset etc. is avaialble
  - See documentation, Exploratory Data Analysis (1) and (2)
- Nice for exploring, but it's recommended that the final plots are made in R, with the help of ggplot2, tmap etc., in a reproducible manner
- GeoDa can also do some spatial regression analysis

# Spatial regression analysis

.left-column[
- Follows Anselins recommendations
  - classic OLS
  - Spatial lag
  - Spatial error
- No SLX (necessary to follow leSage 2014)
- Do your spatial econometrics in R, with sp/sf
